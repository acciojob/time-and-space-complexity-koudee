	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to complete as a function of the input size. In simpler terms, it measures how the algorithm's execution time grows with the input size. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient as it can handle larger inputs more quickly.</p>

<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another crucial aspect that evaluates the amount of memory space an algorithm requires concerning the input size. Notably, we denote <b>space complexity</b> using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> provides insights into the maximum amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution, helping us analyze and optimize memory usage in our programs.</p>
